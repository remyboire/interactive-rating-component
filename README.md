## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Javascript


### What I learned

This challenge wasn't too hard for me so I tried to animate this as a flip card, in order to discover new techniques.
I struggle to get the front and the back of the card the same height. I'm not sure if my css is as clean as possible but it seems to work!
I paid a lot of attention to animation, and added a little feature if you click on submit before selecting a rate.
This was a lot of fun, feel free to tel me if you have any advice!
